# ðŸ‘‹ Hi, I'm Simone Meneghetti

I'm a passionate developer with over **7 years of experience in the Spring ecosystem**, and a few years working with **Angular** for front-end development.

Currently, I work as an **Analyst Developer** at a software company, where I continue to deepen my knowledge and expertise in Java and Spring-based technologies.

## ðŸŒ± Still Learning, Still Growing

Even after 7 years, I believe thereâ€™s always more to learn about Spring. Itâ€™s a vast and powerful ecosystem, and Iâ€™m constantly exploring new features, tools, and best practices. These repositories are a reflection of my journey, curiosity, and enthusiasm for building clean, maintainable, and robust backend systems.

## ðŸš€ What Youâ€™ll Find Here

On my GitHub profile, you'll find various **Spring-related projects** â€“ from simple experiments to more structured applications â€“ all built to sharpen my skills and share my passion for this framework.
